# 📚 Book Pass-On

*A simple way for students to share textbooks and help each other succeed.*

## 🌟 Overview

**Book Pass-On** is a community-based web app that lets high school students easily share textbooks with each other. Whether you’re missing a math book, need an English novel, or want to lend your extra copy — this platform makes it easy to find and share books within your school community.

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Search for a book** – Type in the title or subject to see if it’s available.
2. **Check availability** – The system instantly tells you if another student has added that textbook.
3. **Add your own books** – Got a spare? Share it! Other students can then find and request it.
